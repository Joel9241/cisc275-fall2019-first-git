Sequence of Commands to achieve Final State of all four files:
(used vim to create 4 files a.txt, b.txt, c.txt, d.txt)
a.txt is currently untracked so that file can be left as is
In order to have b.txt as modified first it is added then committed:
git add b.txt
git commit -m "b.txt added to repo"
Then change b.txt using vim b.txt and save the changes. Now it is modified.
In order to have c.txt as staged (run this after d.txt is commited to the repo so it does not get commited with d.txt):
git add c.txt
To have d in the repo:
git add d.txt
git commit -m "added d.txt to repo"
